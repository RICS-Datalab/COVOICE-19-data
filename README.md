# COVOICE-19-data

Welcome to the COVOICE-19 project dataset repository. This project aims to provide a comprehensive dataset for COVID-19 research containing both audio samples and chest X-rays. The dataset is generated using scripts that are compatible with both Unix-like and Windows systems.

## Usage

To generate the dataset, you need to run the appropriate script for your system:

- For Unix-like systems (including Linux distributions and macOS), use the `generate_dataset.sh` script. You can run it in your terminal as follows:

```sh
./generate_dataset.sh
```

- For Windows systems, use the `generate_dataset.ps1` script. You can run it in PowerShell as follows:

```sh
.\generate_dataset.ps1
```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run these scripts on your system.
